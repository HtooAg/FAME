# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the artist dashboard routing system, super admin real-time data updates, and notification system. The improvements will ensure proper artist dashboard access with ID-based routing, real-time data updates in the super admin interface without manual refresh, and a functional notification system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Artist Dashboard Dynamic Routing

**User Story:** As a registered artist, I want to access my dashboard with a proper ID-based route after completing registration, so that I can view my specific profile and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an artist completes registration THEN the system SHALL redirect to `/artist-dashboard/[artistId]` instead of `/artist-dashboard`
2. WHEN an artist accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL fetch their specific profile data using the artistId parameter
3. WHEN the "Go to Dashboard" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to the artist's specific dashboard with their ID
4. WHEN an artist accesses `/artist-dashboard` without an ID THEN the system SHALL redirect to their specific dashboard or show an error if no profile exists
5. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display the correct artist's information based on the URL parameter

### Requirement 2: Super Admin Real-time Data Updates

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want to see real-time updates of artist registrations and stage manager data without manual refresh, so that I can manage users efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new artists register THEN the super admin dashboard SHALL automatically update the artist count and list
2. WHEN stage manager status changes THEN the super admin dashboard SHALL reflect the changes immediately
3. WHEN the super admin dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for real-time updates
4. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL push updates to all connected super admin clients
5. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 3: Artist Data Integration in Super Admin

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want to see all registered artists from the GCS artists folders in my dashboard, so that I can manage all user accounts from one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the super admin dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch all artist data from GCS artists folders
2. WHEN artists are displayed THEN the system SHALL show artist name, real name, email, style, event, status, and registration date
3. WHEN the super admin views artists THEN the system SHALL provide options to activate/deactivate artist accounts
4. WHEN artist status is updated THEN the system SHALL save changes to GCS and update the display
5. WHEN the artist list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show accurate counts in the statistics cards

### Requirement 4: Notification System Implementation

**User Story:** As a user (artist, stage manager, or super admin), I want to see a notification icon that shows relevant notifications, so that I can stay informed about important updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a notification bell icon in the header
2. WHEN there are unread notifications THEN the notification icon SHALL show a badge with the count
3. WHEN the notification icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with recent notifications
4. WHEN notifications are viewed THEN the system SHALL mark them as read and update the badge count
5. WHEN new notifications arrive THEN the system SHALL update the notification count in real-time

### Requirement 5: WebSocket Integration for Super Admin

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want the system to use WebSocket connections for real-time updates, so that I don't need to manually refresh to see new data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the super admin dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection
2. WHEN artist registrations occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to connected super admin clients
3. WHEN stage manager approvals happen THEN the system SHALL send real-time updates to the super admin dashboard
4. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL authenticate the super admin user
5. WHEN data updates are received THEN the system SHALL update the UI components without full page refresh

### Requirement 6: Artist Dashboard Profile Data Accuracy

**User Story:** As an artist, I want my dashboard to display accurate and complete profile information, so that I can verify my registration details are correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the artist dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch the artist's complete profile from GCS using their ID
2. WHEN profile data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show all registration information including music tracks, gallery files, and technical requirements
3. WHEN the artist views their profile THEN the system SHALL display their current registration status
4. WHEN profile data is missing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages and guidance
5. WHEN the artist edits their profile THEN the system SHALL maintain the correct ID-based routing

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully when accessing dashboards or real-time features, so that I have a smooth experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid artist ID is provided THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message and redirect options
2. WHEN WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to periodic polling for updates
3. WHEN GCS data cannot be fetched THEN the system SHALL show loading states and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to the appropriate login page
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages and retry options
